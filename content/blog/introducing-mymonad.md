Today we're excited to announce MyMonad, a new approach to peer-to-peer compatibility that puts privacy first.

## The Problem

Modern applications increasingly require users to share personal information to enable matching and compatibility features. Dating apps, professional networking platforms, and social discovery tools all face the same fundamental challenge: how do you help people find compatible matches without exposing sensitive preferences and traits?

Traditional approaches force a difficult tradeoff. Either users must reveal everything to a central server that performs matching, or they're limited to basic filtering that misses deeper compatibility signals. Neither option respects user autonomy or privacy.

## Our Solution

MyMonad takes a different approach. Using advanced cryptographic techniques, we enable rich compatibility matching while keeping your actual preferences private.

Here's how it works:

1. **Local-First Processing**: Your preferences and traits are processed locally on your device. Raw data never leaves your control.

2. **Homomorphic Encryption**: Compatibility calculations happen on encrypted data. Even the servers facilitating connections can't see what's being compared.

3. **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: When a match is found, cryptographic proofs verify compatibility without revealing the underlying details.

4. **Decentralized Architecture**: No single entity controls the network. Nodes communicate peer-to-peer, with no central point of failure or surveillance.

## Get Started

MyMonad is open source and available today. You can:

- Read our [manifesto](/manifesto/) to understand our philosophy
- Explore [how it works](/how-it-works/) for technical details
- Follow the [getting started guide](/get-started/) to run your own node
- Browse the [documentation](/docs/) for comprehensive reference

## What's Next

This is just the beginning. Our roadmap includes:

- Mobile SDKs for iOS and Android
- Additional matching algorithms for specialized use cases
- Enhanced network resilience features
- Formal security audits

We believe privacy-preserving technology should be the default, not the exception. MyMonad is our contribution toward that future.
