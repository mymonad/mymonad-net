## MeetMyMonad: Dating

The original inspiration. Traditional dating apps commodify loneliness—they profit when you stay single, swiping forever. MeetMyMonad inverts the incentive structure.

### How It Works

1. **Define your authentic self**: Interests, values, deal-breakers processed locally
2. **Encrypted matching**: Compatibility computed without revealing preferences
3. **Mutual threshold**: Both parties must exceed compatibility threshold
4. **Verified handshake**: Cryptographic proof of mutual interest before any reveal
5. **Consent-first contact**: Secure channel opens only after 5-stage handshake

### What's Different

- **No swiping**: Binary choices dehumanize. Continuous compatibility doesn't.
- **No profiles to stalk**: You can't see someone until you match
- **No algorithm manipulation**: Open source, auditable, no engagement farming
- **No data harvesting**: Your romantic preferences never leave your device

## Professional Networking

LinkedIn knows your career ambitions, your job searches, your professional insecurities. They monetize your anxiety. MyMonad offers an alternative.

### Applications

- **Co-founder matching**: Find partners with complementary skills and aligned values
- **Mentor discovery**: Connect with experienced professionals in your field
- **Collaborator search**: Find researchers or creators for joint projects
- **Job matching**: Companies and candidates meet through verified compatibility

### Privacy Advantages

- Recruiters can't see you're looking until mutual interest is proven
- Your professional profile isn't scraped for ad targeting
- Career moves remain private until you choose disclosure

## Community Building

Finding your tribe shouldn't require broadcasting your identity to the world.

### Use Cases

- **Interest-based communities**: Niche hobbies without public exposure
- **Support groups**: Sensitive topics with privacy guarantees
- **Local connections**: Neighbors with shared interests, revealed only mutually
- **Event organization**: Gather compatible attendees without public RSVPs

### How Communities Form

1. Define community parameters and compatibility criteria
2. Members join by generating compatible embeddings
3. Mutual matches aggregate into community clusters
4. Secure group channels form for verified members

## Business Matching

B2B relationships built on verified compatibility, not cold outreach.

### Applications

- **Vendor discovery**: Find service providers matching your requirements
- **Partnership formation**: Identify complementary businesses
- **Investor matching**: Connect founders with aligned investors
- **Client acquisition**: Attract clients who genuinely need your services

### Enterprise Features

- Self-hosted nodes for organizational control

MyMonad is a protocol, not a product. The use cases above are just the beginning.
