## Contributing

MyMonad is built in the open. We welcome contributions that align with our core principles:

- **Privacy first** - No telemetry, no tracking, no cloud dependencies
- **Local computation** - All AI processing happens on your hardware
- **Cryptographic trust** - Math, not reputation, determines compatibility
- **Individual sovereignty** - You own your data, your keys, your destiny
