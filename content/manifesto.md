## I. Sovereignty is a Local Calculation

Your digital essence does not belong on a corporate server. It must not be extracted, labeled, and sold to feed mass-manipulation algorithms. MyMonad asserts that an individual's truth is private property that must be calculated locally, on your own hardware, under your own responsibility.

## II. Isolation as Protection

Like Leibnizian monads, our agents are "windowless". Nothing enters or leaves in the clear. We reject the digital exhibitionism of traditional social networks. Interaction is not an exposure; it is a mathematical validation. We do not seek to be seen; we seek to be recognized by our peers through the cold lens of cosine distance.

## III. Pre-established Harmony through Proof

Current social chaos is the byproduct of a lack of logic and structural dishonesty. We replace blind "trust" with Cryptographic Attestation and a 5-stage Handshake. If two monads are compatible, it is because the math proves it, not because a marketing department decided it.

## IV. Individual Responsibility

The network is decentralized. There is no master, no corrupt state to save you from your own errors. You own your keys; you own your Monad. If you lose your access, you lose your world. This is the real price of freedom.
